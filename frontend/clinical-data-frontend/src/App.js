// Note: Make sure to replace the client_id in the authorization URL with your actual client ID.
// This code assumes you have a backend server running on localhost:8000 that handles the Fitbit OAuth2 flow and provides the daily activity data.
// The backend should be set up to handle the token exchange and store the access token securely.
// The frontend is a simple React app that allows users to input a date and access token, fetches the daily activity data from the backend, and displays it.
//  The app also handles errors gracefully, providing feedback to the user if the fetch fails.
// The UI is styled with basic CSS for better readability and user experience.
// The app is designed to be user-friendly, guiding users through the process of authorizing with Fitbit and fetching their activity data.
// The app is responsive and should work well on different screen sizes.
// The code is modular and can be easily extended to include more features or handle additional data from the Fitbit API.
// The app is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
// It uses functional components and hooks (useState) for state management, making the code clean and easy to understand.
// The app is designed to be easily maintainable, with clear separation of concerns and well-defined functions.
// The app is ready for deployment and can be integrated with a backend server to provide a complete solution for fetching and displaying Fitbit activity data.
// The app can be further enhanced with additional features, such as user authentication, data visualization, and more detailed activity reports.
// The app is a great starting point for anyone looking to build a fitness tracking application using the Fitbit API.
// It provides a solid foundation for further development and customization, allowing developers to create a unique user experience tailored to their needs.
//The app is open-source and can be freely modified and distributed, making it a valuable resource for developers
// looking to learn more about working with APIs and building web applications.
